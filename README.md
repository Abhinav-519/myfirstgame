# We have done this project as a group of two members.
The group member Registration numbers are as follows :
18pa1a0519,
18pa1a1240
After that we have trained our model using teachable machine and connected the code with snake game.
Then after connecting with teachable model we use our hands to play the game.

# How to play
   We trained teachable machine with the following  gestures:-
        1. Raising the right hand to turn right.
        2. Raising the left hand to turn left.
        3. Right hand's thumb directing up will make snake to move up.
        4. Right hand's thumb directing down will make snake to move down.
